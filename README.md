## Introduction

March 2023 Women in Tech hackathon.

Women working are often underrepresented in technical roles, particularly in leadership positions. This can create a culture where women feel isolated and excluded, and may not have role models or mentors to support their career development.

### User stories

* As a woman in a technical role and user of the Fem Code website, I want to be able to connect with other women in similar positions to share experiences, advice, and support. I would like the website to provide a platform for networking and community building, with features such as a forum, groups, and events. 

* As a woman in a technical role and user of the Fem Code website, I want to be able to connect with experienced women in my field to learn from their experiences and get advice on navigating my career. I would like the website to offer a mentorship program that matches me with a mentor who can provide guidance and support.
 
* As a woman aspiring to a leadership role in a technical field and user of the Fem Code website, I want to be able to access resources and guidance on career development, leadership skills, and overcoming gender bias. I would like the website to offer  articles, webinars and training courses tailored to women in tech.
